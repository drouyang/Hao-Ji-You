A voice recognition system prototype for voice based programming.

It utilizes Google Speech Recognition API on Chrome as a frontend for speech
recognition. A Javascript programming running on Chrome initializes the speech
recognition engine, and then whatever recognized to a remote server over web
socket API.

A python backend application is included in this package as well, which
currently only echo what ever received.
